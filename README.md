# AudioEndPointLibrary
A library using the code of [DefSound](https://defsound.codeplex.com) to provides access to Default Sound Devices.

This library wouldn't exists without the amazing work of [EreTIk](http://eretik.omegahg.com/). His reverse-engeneering of the audio control panel of Windows is what made all this possible. Consider him as the main author of this library since my changes as quite minor. The only reason of the existence of this library is to provide a DLL instead of a whole application.
